# Chicago Taxi Parking Ticket Analysis

Taxi drivers have to navigate additional regulations around parking, especially
concerning overnight parking in residential or business streets. [Chicago city ordinance](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/parking_your_commercialtruckinchicago.html)
identifies certain exemptions, but the specifics are often vague, and in some cases
not actually enforced.

The data for this repo comes from a FOIA request, and the tickets are from the beginning
of 2009 through around March 10, 2016. Additional notes on the data are in the
[Data Cleanup Notes](Data Cleanup Notes.ipynb) notebook.

The Jupyter notebooks in this repo mostly focus on residential and business street
parking tickets. In particular, numbers around challenging tickets, the results
of challenging tickets, inconsistencies in the enforcement of exemptions, and the
proportion of immigrants in areas with a high number of residential parking tickets
are looked at.
